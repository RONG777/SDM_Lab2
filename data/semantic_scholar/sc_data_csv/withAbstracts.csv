65325816,"Paroxysmal dyskinesias refer to category of abnormal involuntary movements, such as chorea, dystonia, athetosis, ballism or their various configurations. Depending on the type of seizure, sudden movement, stress, emotions, coffee or alcohol may be the trigger factors. Acute seizures are characterized by short duration and are self-limitated. Patients present correct portray of movements between seizures. Intact consciousness during seizure is the invariable characteristic of all paroxysmal dyskinesias. The intent of this work is to systematize knowledge about paroxysmal dyskinesias. This research includes synthetic information developed based on specialistic literature cencerned with paroxysmal movement disorders. The authors focused primarily on characteristics of the most important issues in this area, into which types of disorders, their causes and treament as well as psychopathology aspect having crucial influence on patients' life comfort were included. The essence of three categories of seizures were put across more extesively: paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, proxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia and paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia. Primary dyskinesias with genetic basis and secondary to other diseases, such as multiple sclerosis were distinguished. Modes of pharmacological treatment with antiepileptic drug and benzodiazepines were described. Special concern was put on holistic approach to problem of diagnosis and treatment of analyzed movement disorders."

However, these correlations were obtained using 2D imaging of the eye fundus, disregarding information on the third component (depth) of the vascular system. In this paper, we show that the depth component is relevant and should not be disregarded in this analysis. In this way, the relevance of the analysis of the retinal vascular network as a biometrical marker for the general health status of the individual can be increased."
178887072,"Several prospectively randomized trials have shown that the administration of prophylactic oral nonabsorbable antibiotics may be beneficial in decreasing the incidence of infection in granulocytopenic patients, whereas others have not. Intolerable nausea and vomiting have prevented the prolonged use of these agents in some studies. Discontinuation of therapy while patients are still granulocytopenic has carried the risk of life-threatening infections, often with aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative organisms. The benefit of selective decontamination with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole used prophylactically remains controversial. The use of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole may also be associated with the development of resistant, potentially pathogenic, organisms or prolonged neutropenia. These regimens do not appear to be indicated when patients are anticipated to be neutropenic for less than three weeks. Even in patients with prolonged neutropenia, the risks of such treatment must be weighed against potential benefits."

241084347,"In order to understand the effects of irrigation schemes on soil water content and irrigation amount,a soil water probability model was employed to simulate the characteristics of soil water probabilistic distribution and the changes of average soil water content under traditional and continuous irrigation. The results indicated that there was a significant distinction of soil water probabilistic distribution for different irrigation schemes,and the maximum value of probability density function of soil water appeared at s = s*for continuous irrigation,but s = sfcfor traditional irrigation. Compared to traditional irrigation,continuous irrigation kept the soil water content at a lower level,thus reducing leakage losses and surface runoff by storing more water into the soil when rainfall happened. Therefore,continuous irrigation could significantly increase the use efficiency of agricultural water resources by improving the utilization rate of rainwater and reducing the amount of irrigation water."

240775538,"In chick embryos treated with a 4 hr pulse of 7.2 X 10(-5) M isonicotinic acid hydrazide (INH) the cell population growth is inhibited with an increased population doubling time. Teratogenised blastoderm cells complete their ongoing cell cycle and arrest in G1 phase. A chase with an equimolar concentration of pyridoxal-5-phosphate restores the growth rate after a lag of 4 hr equivalent to the duration of treatment with INH. Presumptive mesoblast cells invaginated through the primitive streak and neuroectoblast cells induced prior to the application of INH differentiate, while the teratogen inhibits morphogenesis and organization of organ primordia."
237842496,"Selulosa asetat adalah senyawa turunan selulosa yang banyak digunakan sebagai serat, membran, dan film fotografi. Selama ini selulosa asetat dibuat dari selulosa kayu yang telah dipisahkan dari lignin dan hemiselulosa. Sumber selulosa kayu memerlukan waktu tanam yang lama dan proses pemisahan selulosa yang tidak efektif Penemuan metode sintesis bioselulosa nata de coco dari fermentasi air kelapa menyediakan sumber selulosa bare dengan keunggulan sifat selulosa yang murni dan mudah didegradasi. 
Selulosa asetat disintesis melalui reaksi asetilasi. Atom hidrogen pada gugus hidroksil bioselulosa nata de coco disubstitusi dengan gugus asetil, setelah sebelumnya bioselulosa nata de coco digembungkan dengan asam asetat. Katalis yang dipakai adalah asam sulfat dan reaksi asetilasi dilakukan pada suhu sekitar 5 °C. 
Spektra FTIR menunjukkan gugus-gugus fungsi produk asetilasi adalah selulosa asetat. Melalui metode XRD diketahui kristalinitas selulosa asetat lebih rendah daripada kristalinitas bioselulosa nata de coco. Kekuatan tarik selulosa asetat dengan metode tensile strength menunjukkan penurunan kekuatan tarik selulosa asetat seiring bertambahnya asam asetat anhidrid yang digunakan pada reaksi asetilasi. Cellulose acetate is a derivative of cellulose that widely used as fiber, membrane, and photographic films. So far, cellulose acetate was made from wood cellulose that had been purified from lignin and hemicelullose. Wood cellulose sources take long time to be used as raw material and the purification process is uneffective. Biocellulose nata de coco that synthezed from coconut water provided new source of cellulose with highly pure cellulose and degradable. 
Acetylation reaction was done to obtain cellulose acetate. The hydrogen atom of hidroxyl groups of biocellulose nata de coco were substituted by acetyl groups, after biocellulose nata de coco was swollen by acetic acid. This process using sulfuric acid as a catalyst and was done in approximate 5 °C. 
FTIR spectra proves that functional group that obtained in acetylation reaction is cellulose acetate. XRD spectra indicated that cellulose acetate crystalinity is lower than biocellulose nata de coco crystalinity. Tensile strength graphic showed that raising the concentration of acetic anhydride in acetylation reaction can decrease the tensile strength of cellulose acetate."

247834289,"Modernity is characterized by profound changes in all spheres of human life caused by the global transformations on macro and micro levels of social reality. These changes allow us to speak about the present as the era of civilizational transition in the mode of uncertainty. Therefore, this situation demands qualitative transformations of human adaptive strategies and educational technologies accordingly. The dominant role in the dynamics of pedagogics and andragogy’s landscape belongs to transformative learning. The transformative learning theory is considered as the relevant approach to education of the individual, which is able to become an autonomous communicative actor of the social complexity. The article considers the cognitive technologies of social cohesion development and perspectives of their implementation in the educational dimension. In addition to implementing the principles of inclusion, equity in education, an important factor for improving social cohesion, stability and unity of society is the development of cognitive educational technologies. The key factors and foundations for the cognitive educational technologies are transversal competencies. They create the conditions for civil, public dialogue, non-violent type of communication. These “21st century skills” are extremely important for better human adaptation. One of the aspects and roots of social adaptation is social cohesion. Mutual determinations and connections between social cohesion development and transversal competences have been shown. The perspective direction of further researches is to find a methodological base for the further development of cognitive education technologies and platform for realization of innovative services for educational programs. New educational paradigm offers the concept of human adaptation as cognitive effectiveness and how to reach it through educational technologies. The article includes topics of creative thinking, teambuilding abilities, effective decision-making, engagement in the learning and teaching processes, cognitive skills improvement, social cohesion abilities, etc."

252693062,"To search for signals from extreme short bursts in the universe, we have performed the large-scale coincidence analysis, using EAS data from five stations of the Large Area Air Shower (LAAS) group. By comparing arrival times and arrival directions of EAS detected at distant stations, coincident and parallel EAS pairs were extracted out of a sea of background cosmic rays. One of them was intriguingly observed from directions consistent with the Crab Nebula, a previously reported UHE γ-ray source. The preliminary results reported here allow the analysis techniques to be tested and demonstrate the potential of observations with the full operation of the network detector system as a cosmic ray interferometer. pp. 191–194 c ©2003 by Universal Academy Press, Inc."
201659424,This thesis is about the numerical calculation of loop integrals which appear at higher orders in perturbative theory. Analogous to the reel emission one can introduce subtraction terms which remove the collinear and soft divergencies of a loop integral. The phase space and the loop integration can then be performed numerical in single Monte Carlo integration. In this thesis we show how to perform such a numerical integration with the help of contour deformation. We also show how one can calculate the necessary integrands with recurrence relations.
